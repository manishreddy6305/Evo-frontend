    "question": "Why would I pay for video hosting, when I can get it for nothing?",
    "answer": "A free Basic membership is pretty great, but if you want priority support, tons more storage, advanced privacy control, player customization, or interaction tools (like cards and calls to action in the embedded player), you’ll want to join our other membership plans. And unlike YouTube, we never put ads before, during, or after your videos."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I cancel anytime?",
    "answer": "Yes, all our plans are risk-free. You’ll get a full refund if you decide to cancel anytime within the first 30 days of an annual membership, or within the first five days of a monthly membership. If you no longer need the added benefits of your current membership, you can downgrade to another tier."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will viewers see third-party ads on my videos?",
    "answer": "Absolutely not. Your work will never be tarnished by in-video ads. That’s right — no pre-roll, post-roll, or overlays. On Vimeo, you can present your work in exactly the way you want."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you have duration or file-size restrictions?",
    "answer": "No way! Unlike other video-hosting platforms, there are no file-size or duration limits up to your weekly or total storage limit."
